# CMPE255 Team Project

This repository contains three main files for our project:

## Files

1. **LSTM.py**
    - This file contains the implementation of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for time series forecasting.

2. **ARIMA.py**
    - This file includes the implementation of the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model for time series analysis and forecasting.

3. **XGBoost.py**
    - This file provides the implementation of the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model for regression and classification tasks.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cmpe255-team-project.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd cmpe255-team-project
    ```
3. Run the desired model file:
    ```bash
    python LSTM.py
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    python ARIMA.py
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    python XGBoost.py
    ```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow (for LSTM), statsmodels (for ARIMA), xgboost (for XGBoost)

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
